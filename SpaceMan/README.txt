SPACEMAN

Objective of the game is to collect all the oxygen pellets.
If you are caught by the alien you lose however if you manage to collect all the pellets without getting caught you win.
Players can also make use of the teleport points to escape the trailing alien however the teleport locations are randomized so high risk to high reward.
